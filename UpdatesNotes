1. Habit Controller is mostly done, though error checking is not yet carried out, should be a priority.
2. HabitEvent class is renamed as Event for simplicity.
3. Habit class is changed slightly to throw the proper (CommentTooLong) exceptions; WeekSchedule class is modified by adding a toString function.
4. Habit can now be added without crashing, however, local saves are not yet done.
5. It is prudent to work on EventController and ProfileController as soon as possible. I will take the ProfileController, as it must be implmented
    for the habits to save properly. Suggestions are welcomed.
6. For most cases, a factory design pattern (integrate with MVC) is suficient.
