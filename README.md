Features Overview

HabitTracker allows users to keep their life in check by setting up useful reminders for tasks that recur on a weekly basis. The main menu contains four options: Events, Habits, Social, and Profile.
Upon logging in, the user is prompted to choose a user name. This corresponds to a unique account for every in user which they can save habit reminders locally and track the history of habit events they have completed. A “habit event” is any activity associated with a habit that the user decides to define.
The user should first visit the habit page, where they can add a new habit that they want to keep track of. When adding a habit, the user can choose what days of the week the habit occurs on as well as the start date. Optionally, they can add a text comment detailing the reason for the habit. When you are done adding a habit, it will show on a list of completed habits. From here, you can tap a habit to edit the info associated with it, delete it or show statistics associated with it. (Fill in statistic info).
From the events page, the user can add an event for the current date that is associated with a habit. When adding a new event, the user is prompted to add a description and can optionally take a photo to be associated with the event and can attach a location based on their phone’s current position. For all listed events for a given habit, the user can view a map showing all of the events that have had a location attached. You can also list all of the habit events without filtering by habit and can choose to filter with a keyword. 
The social page is the hub where you can connect to others using the app and compare habits. The followers page lists everyone following you and allows you to accept or reject follower requests. The following page shows who you are following and allows you to search for a user and send a follower request, pending approval from that user.  (What does social feed show?)
Finally, the profile screen tracks statistics associated with your account, including your numbers of followers and followees as well as your account level and achievements (????) You can also log out of your profile from here.
